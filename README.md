# dgi14 Voxel Renderer

This is a voxel renderer for the dgi14 course at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),
created by Adrian Blanco and Hampus Liljekvist.  It renders voxels with textures, as the
title suggests.  A natural looking landscape is generated using Perlin noise, in a style
similar to a popular mining and crafting simulator.

The software is based on the [Glescraft](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming/Glescraft_1) tutorial.

### Usage
The camera is controlled with `W, A, S, D` and the arrow keys.
Use the mouse to look around.
Press `Space` to rise and hold `Alt` to increase the movement speed.
Remove a block by right-clicking on it, and create a new block with left-click.
Exit by pressing `Escape`.
